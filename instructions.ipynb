    "1. **Create a Flask Web Application Project**:\n",
    "   - Start by creating a new directory for your Flask project.\n",
    "   - Inside the project directory, create a new Python script (e.g., `app.py`) to define your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transfer Your Model Code to `app.py`**:\n",
    "   - Copy the code for your model from your Jupyter Notebook into the `app.py` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Import Flask and Initialize Your App**:\n",
    "   - In the `app.py` script, import Flask and create a Flask web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Routes**:\n",
    "   - Define the routes that your web application will respond to. For example, you might want to create a route for receiving loan application data and returning loan approval predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.route('/')\n",
    "   def home():\n",
    "       return 'Welcome to the Loan Approval Web App'\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "   def predict():\n",
    "       # Parse the incoming data and use your model to make predictions\n",
    "       # Return the prediction results\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Form Handling**:\n",
    "   - If your web app will accept data from users via forms, you'll need to handle form submissions. You can use Flask-WTF or HTML forms with Flask's `request` object for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Loading**:\n",
    "   - Load your machine learning model in the `app.py` script. You can load it at the top of your script or within the route that requires it. Make sure your model is available for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Prediction and Response**:\n",
    "   - Inside the route where predictions are made (`/predict` in this example), use your model to process the incoming data and generate predictions.\n",
    "   - Return the predictions as an HTTP response, typically in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Run the Flask App**:\n",
    "   - At the end of your `app.py` script, add the following code to run the Flask app:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "       app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Test Your Web App Locally**:\n",
    "   - Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the Flask app:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python app.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your web app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Access Your Web App**:\n",
    "    - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to test your web app locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Deploy to a Production Server**:\n",
    "    - Once you've tested your web app and are satisfied with its functionality, you can deploy it to a production server. Common choices for deployment include cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Add Frontend (Optional)**:\n",
    "    - For a more user-friendly interface, consider adding a frontend to your web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flask can serve both the backend (API) and frontend (web pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to handle any data validation, error handling, and security considerations in your web application. Additionally, consider setting up environment variables for sensitive information, such as API keys or model paths, instead of hardcoding them directly into your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified overview of the process, but it should help you get started with deploying your model as a Flask web application. You can further refine and expand your application as needed, based on your specific requirements."
